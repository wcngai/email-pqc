# PQC Email - User Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to Quantum-Safe Email

The Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) email system protects your email communications against future quantum computing threats. This guide will help you get started quickly and understand the key features.

## What's New

Your email experience remains exactly the same, with these important security enhancements:

- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Your emails are protected against quantum computers
- **Hybrid Security**: Uses both post-quantum and traditional encryption for maximum protection
- **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with your existing Outlook workflow
- **Visual Security Indicators**: Clear badges show when emails are quantum-safe

## Visual Indicators

### Security Badges

When composing or reading emails, look for these security indicators:

| Icon | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| üîí | **Quantum-Safe** | Email is protected with post-quantum cryptography |
| üîê | **Hybrid Protected** | Email uses both quantum-safe and traditional encryption |
| üîì | **Traditional Encryption** | Email uses standard encryption only |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | **Unencrypted** | Email is not encrypted (rare - will prompt you) |

### Status Messages

- **"Quantum-Safe Email Ready"** - Recipient supports PQC encryption
- **"Hybrid Mode Active"** - Using both PQC and traditional encryption
- **"Traditional Encryption"** - Recipient doesn't support PQC yet
- **"Encryption Required"** - Company policy requires encryption for this recipient

## Daily Workflow

### Sending Emails

1. **Compose as Usual**
   - Open Outlook and create a new email
   - Add recipients, subject, and content normally
   - The system automatically detects recipient capabilities

2. **Check Security Status**
   - Look for the security badge before sending
   - Green indicators mean quantum-safe protection
   - Yellow indicates traditional encryption
   - Red requires attention

3. **Send with Confidence**
   - Click Send - no additional steps required
   - The system automatically applies the best available encryption
   - You'll see a confirmation with security details

### Reading Emails

1. **Automatic Decryption**
   - Encrypted emails open automatically
   - No passwords or additional steps needed
   - Security badge shows protection level used

2. **Reply with Same Security**
   - Replies maintain the same encryption level
   - System remembers recipient preferences
   - Forward options preserve security settings

## Understanding Encryption Modes

### Quantum-Safe Mode üîí
- **Best Protection**: Resistant to quantum computer attacks
- **When Used**: Both you and recipient have PQC capabilities
- **Performance**: Slightly slower than traditional (usually unnoticeable)
- **Compatibility**: Works with all modern email systems

### Hybrid Mode üîê
- **Maximum Compatibility**: Works with all recipients
- **Double Protection**: Both quantum-safe AND traditional encryption
- **When Used**: Default mode for maximum security
- **File Size**: Slightly larger encrypted messages

### Traditional Mode üîì
- **Legacy Support**: For recipients without PQC support
- **Automatic Fallback**: System switches automatically when needed
- **Still Secure**: Uses strong traditional encryption
- **Temporary**: Recipients are gradually upgrading to PQC

## Common Scenarios

### Sending to External Partners

**Scenario**: Sending sensitive financial data to external auditor
```
‚úÖ What You'll See: "Quantum-Safe Email Ready" 
‚úÖ Action: Send normally - full PQC protection applied
‚úÖ Result: Email encrypted with ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65
```

**Scenario**: Sending to client who hasn't upgraded yet
```
‚ö†Ô∏è What You'll See: "Traditional Encryption - Recipient Upgrading"
‚úÖ Action: Send normally - strong traditional encryption used
‚úÖ Result: Email encrypted with RSA-OAEP + RSA-PSS
```

### Internal Company Emails

**Scenario**: Sending quarterly report to executive team
```
‚úÖ What You'll See: "Hybrid Mode Active - Maximum Protection"
‚úÖ Action: Send normally - dual encryption applied
‚úÖ Result: Protected against current AND future threats
```

**Scenario**: Regular team communication
```
‚úÖ What You'll See: "Quantum-Safe Email Ready"
‚úÖ Action: Send normally - optimized PQC encryption
‚úÖ Result: Fast quantum-safe protection
```

### Handling Attachments

**Large Documents**:
- System automatically handles encryption
- No file size limits for encryption
- Compression applied when beneficial
- Password protection not needed

**Sensitive Files**:
- Enhanced protection for classified attachments
- Automatic classification detection
- Additional audit logging
- Retention policy enforcement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: "My email is taking longer to send"**
- A: Post-quantum encryption requires slightly more processing time
- This is normal and typically adds less than 2 seconds
- Performance improves over time as system learns your patterns

**Q: "I see a warning about encryption"**
- A: This means the recipient cannot receive encrypted email
- Contact IT support - this should be rare
- Use alternative communication method for sensitive data

**Q: "The security badge shows yellow instead of green"**
- A: Yellow means traditional encryption (still very secure)
- This happens when recipient doesn't support PQC yet
- Your email is still protected with strong encryption

**Q: "I need to send an urgent unencrypted email"**
- A: This is typically blocked by company policy
- Contact your manager or IT support for exception
- Emergency procedures are available for critical situations

### Getting Help

**Self-Service**:
- Check the security badge first
- Try sending to a different recipient
- Restart Outlook if badges aren't appearing

**IT Support**:
- Email: it-support@company.com
- Phone: +1-555-IT-HELP
- Internal Chat: #it-support
- Emergency: +1-555-EMERGENCY

**When to Contact Support**:
- Encryption errors persist
- Security badges missing
- Unable to read encrypted emails
- Performance significantly degraded

## Security Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

- **Trust the System**: Let PQC handle encryption automatically
- **Check Security Badges**: Verify protection level before sending sensitive data
- **Report Issues Promptly**: Contact IT if anything seems wrong
- **Keep Outlook Updated**: Install updates when prompted
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Protect your Outlook account

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- **Don't Disable Encryption**: Even if it seems slower
- **Don't Share Certificates**: Keep your digital certificates private
- **Don't Ignore Warnings**: Always investigate security alerts
- **Don't Use Workarounds**: Contact IT instead of bypassing security
- **Don't Panic**: The system is designed to protect you automatically

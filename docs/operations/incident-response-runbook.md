# PQC Email System - Incident Response Runbook

## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for responding to incidents related to the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) email system. It is designed for IT support staff, security teams, and operations personnel.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | System completely unavailable, security breach, data loss | 15 minutes | CISO, CTO |
| **P2 - High** | Major functionality impaired, performance severely degraded | 1 hour | IT Director |
| **P3 - Medium** | Partial functionality affected, workarounds available | 4 hours | Team Lead |
| **P4 - Low** | Minor issues, cosmetic problems | 24 hours | Standard Queue |

### Incident Types

**Security Incidents**:
- Cryptographic key compromise
- Certificate authority compromise
- Policy violation detection
- Unauthorized system access
- Data breach or exposure

**Operational Incidents**:
- Service outages or unavailability
- Performance degradation
- Configuration errors
- Integration failures
- Capacity issues

**User-Reported Issues**:
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Outlook add-in problems
- Certificate issues
- Performance complaints
- Training/usage questions

## Initial Response Procedures

### Step 1: Immediate Assessment (5 minutes)

1. **Log Incident Details**
   ```powershell
   # Create incident record
   $incident = @{
       ID = "INC-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss')"
       Severity = "TBD"
       Reporter = "Reporter Name"
       Description = "Brief description"
       Timestamp = Get-Date
       System = "PQC Email"
   }
   
   # Log to incident tracking system
   New-IncidentRecord @incident
   ```

2. **Initial Triage Questions**
   - Is this affecting multiple users or systems?
   - Is sensitive data at risk?
   - Are workarounds available?
   - When did the issue start?
   - What changed recently?

3. **Check System Status Dashboard**
   ```powershell
   # Check system health
   .\PqcEmail.HealthCheck.exe --comprehensive
   
   # Check recent alerts
   Get-EventLog -LogName "Application" -Source "PQC Email" -After (Get-Date).AddHours(-2)
   
   # Check monitoring dashboard
   Start-Process "https://monitoring.company.com/pqc-email"
   ```

### Step 2: Classification and Escalation (10 minutes)

1. **Classify Severity**
   - Use decision tree (see Appendix A)
   - Consider business impact
   - Factor in security implications

2. **Initial Escalation**
   ```powershell
   # P1/P2 incidents - immediate escalation
   if ($severity -in @("P1", "P2")) {
       Send-AlertMessage -Recipients @("it-director@company.com", "security@company.com") -Priority High -Subject "P1/P2 PQC Email Incident: $($incident.ID)"
   }
   ```

3. **Form Response Team**
   - **P1**: Security lead, IT director, system architect
   - **P2**: IT manager, security analyst, subject matter expert
   - **P3/P4**: Assigned technician, backup support

### Step 3: Containment and Stabilization (30 minutes)

1. **Security-First Approach**
   ```powershell
   # If security incident suspected
   if ($incidentType -eq "Security") {
       # Preserve evidence
       Export-AuditLogs -StartTime $incidentStart -OutputPath "C:\Evidence\$($incident.ID)"
       
       # Isolate affected systems if necessary
       # (Only if authorized by security team)
   }
   ```

2. **Immediate Workarounds**
   - Enable fallback to traditional encryption
   - Route traffic around affected components
   - Implement temporary policy changes
   - Communicate workarounds to users

## Incident-Specific Procedures

### Cryptographic Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Users cannot encrypt/decrypt emails
- "Cryptographic operation failed" errors
- Certificate validation errors
- Algorithm fallback loops

**Immediate Actions**:
```powershell
# Check cryptographic provider status
.\PqcEmail.Diagnostics.exe --test-crypto

# Verify certificate store integrity
certlm.msc
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -like "*PQC*"}

# Check HSM connectivity (if applicable)
.\PqcEmail.Diagnostics.exe --test-hsm

# Review recent cryptographic operations
Get-AuditEvents -EventType "CryptographicOperation" -Since (Get-Date).AddHours(-1)
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Verify cryptographic library integrity
2. Check certificate expiration status
3. Test with known-good key pairs
4. Restart cryptographic services
5. Regenerate certificates if necessary

**Rollback Plan**:
- Disable PQC algorithms temporarily
- Fall back to traditional encryption
- Issue emergency certificates
- Notify affected users

### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**:
- Email encryption taking >5 seconds
- Outlook freezing during send/receive
- High CPU/memory usage
- User complaints about slowness

**Immediate Actions**:
```powershell
# Check system performance
Get-Counter "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time"
Get-Counter "\Memory\Available MBytes"
Get-Process -Name "OUTLOOK" | Select-Object CPU,WorkingSet

# Review performance metrics
.\PqcEmail.HealthCheck.exe --performance

# Check for resource leaks
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*PqcEmail*"} | Select-Object *
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Adjust caching parameters
3. Optimize algorithm selection
4. Scale resources if needed
5. Implement rate limiting if necessary

### Certificate Issues

**Symptoms**:
- "Certificate not found" errors
- Certificate validation failures
- OCSP/CRL lookup failures
- Trust chain errors

**Immediate Actions**:
```powershell
# Check certificate status
Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -like "*@company.com"}

# Test certificate chain
certutil -verify -urlfetch certificate.cer

# Check CRL/OCSP services
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName ocsp.company.com -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName crl.company.com -Port 80
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Verify certificate installation
2. Check certificate authority health
3. Update certificate revocation lists
4. Renew expired certificates
5. Update trust relationships

### Outlook Integration Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Add-in not loading
- Security badges missing
- Encryption options unavailable
- Outlook crashes or freezes

**Immediate Actions**:
```powershell
# Check add-in registration
Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\PqcEmail.Connect"

# Check Outlook event logs
Get-EventLog -LogName "Application" -Source "Outlook" -After (Get-Date).AddHours(-2)

# Test add-in in safe mode
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE" /safe
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Re-register Outlook add-in
2. Reset Outlook profile
3. Check for conflicting add-ins
4. Update Outlook and add-in
5. Rebuild Outlook configuration

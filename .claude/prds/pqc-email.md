# PRD: PQC Email for Financial Institutions

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the implementation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for email communications within financial institutions using Microsoft Outlook. The solution addresses the critical threat of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks by implementing NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms (ML-KEM-768 for encryption, ML-DSA-65 for signatures) while maintaining full backward compatibility through hybrid cryptography. The pilot program targets a 3-month MVP delivery with focus on security audit compliance and user-transparent operation.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Financial institutions face an imminent threat from quantum computing advances that could compromise decades of stored encrypted communications. Current RSA and ECDSA encryption methods will become vulnerable to quantum attacks, potentially exposing sensitive financial data, customer information, and strategic communications that adversaries may be collecting today for future decryption.

### Why is this important now?
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Financial regulators are beginning to require quantum-readiness roadmaps
- **Data Longevity**: Financial records must remain confidential for 7-30+ years
- **Attack Timeline**: Quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption may exist within 5-10 years
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later**: Adversaries are likely already collecting encrypted data for future decryption
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Early adoption positions the institution as a security leader

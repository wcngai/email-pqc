# Task: Monitoring & Documentation

## Description
Implement comprehensive audit logging, compliance reporting, and monitoring systems for the PQC email infrastructure. Create complete documentation suite including admin guides, user training materials, and operational runbooks. Build monitoring dashboard to track PQC adoption metrics and system health.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Audit logging system capturing all cryptographic operations and key lifecycle events
- Compliance reporting framework generating automated reports for regulatory requirements
- Complete documentation suite covering admin operations and user workflows
- Real-time monitoring dashboard displaying PQC adoption metrics and system performance

## Technical Details
**Audit Logging & Compliance:**
- Structured logging for all key generation, rotation, and cryptographic operations
- Tamper-evident audit trail with cryptographic integrity protection
- Automated compliance report generation (SOC 2, FIPS 140-2, Common Criteria)
- Data retention policies and secure log archival system

**Documentation Suite:**
- Admin installation and configuration guides
- User training materials for PQC email workflows
- Operational runbooks for incident response and troubleshooting
- API documentation for integration partners
- Security best practices and deployment guidelines

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Real-time metrics on PQC algorithm usage and performance
- Key lifecycle tracking and rotation compliance monitoring
- User adoption analytics and migration progress tracking
- System health metrics with alerting for critical issues
- Performance trending and capacity planning data

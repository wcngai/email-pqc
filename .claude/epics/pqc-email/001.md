# Task: Core Cryptographic Integration

## Description
Integrate post-quantum cryptography libraries and implement a hybrid encryption engine that combines classical and quantum-resistant algorithms. This forms the cryptographic foundation for the entire PQC email system, supporting both ML-KEM-768 (key encapsulation) and ML-DSA-65 (digital signatures) with seamless fallback to classical algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) or BouncyCastle library successfully integrated into .NET project
- Hybrid encryption engine implemented with ML-KEM-768 + AES-256-GCM encryption
- Digital signature system implemented with ML-DSA-65 + RSA-PSS fallback
- Algorithm abstraction layer allows runtime selection between PQC and classical algorithms
- Performance benchmarks show encryption/decryption operations complete within acceptable limits (< 2 seconds for typical email)

## Technical Details
**Library Integration:**
- Evaluate and integrate either Open Quantum Safe .NET wrapper or BouncyCastle's PQC implementation
- Create P/Invoke bindings if using liboqs C library directly
- Implement proper memory management and error handling for cryptographic operations

**Hybrid Encryption Architecture:**
- ML-KEM-768 for quantum-resistant key encapsulation with 192-bit security level
- AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption of message content
- Combine both algorithms transparently with automatic fallback to RSA-OAEP + AES

**Digital Signature Implementation:**
- ML-DSA-65 for post-quantum digital signatures with 192-bit security level  
- RSA-PSS fallback for interoperability with non-PQC systems
- Support for dual signatures (both PQC and classical) for transition period

**Abstraction Layer:**
- ICryptographicProvider interface for algorithm-agnostic operations
- Configuration-driven algorithm selection (PQC-only, hybrid, classical-only)
- Graceful degradation when PQC algorithms unavailable

## Dependencies
- .NET Framework 4.7.2+ or .NET Core 3.1+ for modern cryptographic APIs
- Windows Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) for integration with system crypto
- No external task dependencies - can be developed independently

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40-50
- Parallel: true

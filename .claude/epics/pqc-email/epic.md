# Epic: pqc-email

## Overview
Implement a Microsoft Outlook add-in that provides post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) capabilities for email encryption and signing in financial institutions. The solution uses a hybrid approach combining NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms (ML-KEM-768/ML-DSA-65) with classical cryptography to ensure backward compatibility while protecting against future quantum computing threats.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Hybrid Cryptography Approach**: Combine PQC with classical algorithms (RSA/ECDSA) to maintain compatibility while adding quantum resistance
- **Client-Side Implementation**: Outlook add-in architecture avoids Exchange Server modifications, simplifying deployment
- **Library Selection**: Use Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) or BouncyCastle for validated PQC implementations
- **CMS/S/MIME 4.0**: Leverage KEMRecipientInfo for standard-compliant quantum-safe message format
- **Windows Certificate Store Integration**: Native integration for seamless certificate management
- **Policy-Driven Configuration**: Group Policy Objects (GPO) for enterprise-wide management

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- **Outlook Add-in Framework**: VSTO or Office.js based add-in with COM interop for native integration
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Ribbon UI elements showing quantum-safe encryption status
- **Transparent User Experience**: Auto-detection and encryption without user intervention
- **Certificate Enrollment UI**: Simplified interface for PQC certificate management

### Backend Services
- **Cryptographic Engine**: Core encryption/signing service using validated PQC libraries
- **Capability Discovery Service**: SMIMEA/DNS-based recipient capability detection with caching
- **Certificate Management**: Dual keypair support with automated enrollment and rotation
- **Policy Engine**: Domain-based encryption rules and algorithm enforcement
- **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and security monitoring

### Infrastructure
- **Windows Certificate Store**: Local certificate storage with HSM support via PKCS#11
- **Active Directory Integration**: Certificate distribution and policy management
- **Group Policy Templates**: ADMX templates for centralized configuration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Telemetry collection for encryption operations

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core cryptographic library integration and basic add-in framework
- **Phase 2**: Full encryption/signing implementation with capability discovery
- **Phase 3**: Policy management, monitoring dashboard, and pilot deployment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Extensive compatibility testing, performance benchmarking, gradual rollout
- **Testing Approach**: Unit tests for crypto operations, integration tests for Outlook, E2E tests for complete workflows

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Core Cryptographic Integration: Integrate PQC libraries and implement hybrid encryption engine
- [ ] Outlook Add-in Development: Build VSTO/Office.js add-in with UI indicators and transparent operation

- **Compatibility**: 95% successful delivery with hybrid encryption
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability for crypto operations with graceful fallback
- **Security**: FIPS 203/204 compliance, constant-time operations, side-channel resistance
- **Scalability**: Support 10,000+ users with efficient certificate distribution

## Estimated Effort

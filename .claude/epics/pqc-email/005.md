# Task: Capability Discovery Service

## Description
Implement SMIMEA/DNS-based capability detection system to automatically discover recipient cryptographic capabilities before sending encrypted emails. Create intelligent caching mechanism with 24-hour TTL and build comprehensive recipient capability database for efficient PQC algorithm negotiation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- DNS SMIMEA record queries automatically discover recipient PQC capabilities
- Capability cache reduces DNS lookups with configurable TTL (default 24h)
- Database stores recipient capabilities with algorithm priority preferences
- Fallback mechanism handles cases where SMIMEA records are unavailable

## Technical Details
- Implement DNS resolver for SMIMEA record queries (RFC 8162 extension for PQC)
- Create capability database schema storing email addresses, supported algorithms, preferences
- Build caching layer with Redis/memory cache for DNS responses and capability data
- Implement algorithm negotiation logic preferring strongest mutually supported algorithms
- Create capability discovery API for email client integration
- Support both automatic discovery and manual capability configuration

## Dependencies
- Task 003: Certificate Management System (provides PQC certificate validation)
- DNS resolution library with DNSSEC support
- Database system (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Caching system (Redis optional)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 25-30
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SMIMEA DNS query implementation working
- [ ] Capability database with proper schema and indexing
- [ ] Caching system with configurable TTL implemented
- [ ] Algorithm negotiation logic tested with various scenarios
- [ ] API endpoints for capability queries created
- [ ] Performance tests for DNS resolution and caching efficiency

# Task: Policy Management Engine

## Description
Create comprehensive Group Policy templates (ADMX) and policy management engine for enterprise deployment of PQC email encryption. Implement domain-based encryption rules with intelligent algorithm enforcement and fallback logic to ensure compliance while maintaining email delivery reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ADMX templates available for Windows Group Policy management
- Domain-based rules enforce PQC encryption for specified recipients/domains
- Algorithm enforcement respects organizational security policies
- Fallback logic maintains email delivery when PQC unavailable

## Technical Details
- Create ADMX/ADML templates for Windows Group Policy configuration
- Implement policy engine that reads registry/config for encryption requirements
- Build domain-based rule engine supporting wildcards and regex patterns
- Create algorithm preference matrix with security level enforcement
- Implement fallback chain: PQC hybrid → Classical → Unencrypted (if allowed)
- Support policy inheritance from domain to user level with override capabilities
- Create audit logging for policy enforcement and fallback decisions

## Dependencies
- Task 002: Configuration Management System (provides policy storage/retrieval)
- Windows Group Policy infrastructure
- Registry access for policy reading
- Logging framework for audit trails

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20-25
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADMX/ADML templates created and tested in Active Directory
- [ ] Policy engine correctly enforces domain-based encryption rules
- [ ] Algorithm fallback logic working with configurable security levels
- [ ] Audit logging captures all policy decisions and fallbacks
- [ ] Integration tests with various policy configurations
- [ ] Documentation for enterprise administrators

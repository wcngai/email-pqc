# Task: Email Encryption/Decryption Implementation

## Description
Implement S/MIME message encryption with hybrid algorithms supporting both classical and post-quantum cryptography. Build transparent encryption/decryption workflow that integrates with existing email clients while supporting the new CMS/S/MIME 4.0 KEMRecipientInfo structure for PQC algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- S/MIME messages can be encrypted using hybrid classical+PQC algorithms
- KEMRecipientInfo structure properly implements CMS/S/MIME 4.0 specification
- Decryption workflow transparently handles both legacy and PQC-encrypted messages
- Integration works seamlessly with major email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird)

## Technical Details
- Implement hybrid encryption combining RSA/ECDH with ML-KEM algorithms
- Create KEMRecipientInfo ASN.1 structure per RFC draft specifications
- Build encryption pipeline that generates random KEK, encrypts with recipient's KEM public key
- Implement decryption pipeline that uses private key to recover KEK and decrypt message
- Support graceful fallback from PQC to classical algorithms when recipient doesn't support PQC
- Integrate with existing S/MIME infrastructure and certificate stores

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Algorithm Integration Framework (provides ML-KEM implementation)
- Task 003: Certificate Management System (provides PQC certificate handling)
- OpenSSL 3.0+ with PQC algorithm support
- S/MIME library compatibility layer

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40-50
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with hybrid encryption/decryption
- [ ] KEMRecipientInfo ASN.1 structure correctly implemented
- [ ] Tests written covering encryption/decryption workflows
- [ ] Integration tests with sample email clients
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for encryption/decryption operations
- [ ] Documentation for S/MIME PQC message format

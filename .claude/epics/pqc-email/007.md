# Task: Testing & Security Validation

## Description
Implement a comprehensive testing framework covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the PQC email system. Conduct security validation, prepare for compliance audits, and establish performance benchmarking to ensure the system meets enterprise requirements for post-quantum cryptography deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete test suite with >90% code coverage for PQC components
- Security validation framework with automated vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarks demonstrating acceptable encryption/decryption times
- Audit preparation documentation and compliance validation reports

## Technical Details
**Testing Framework:**
- Unit tests for all PQC cryptographic operations using Jest/Vitest
- Integration tests for email encryption/decryption workflows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys using Playwright
- Load testing for performance validation under concurrent usage

**Security Validation:**
- Automated security scanning with SAST/DAST tools
- Cryptographic implementation validation against NIST standards
- Key management security audit and penetration testing
- Side-channel attack resistance validation

**Performance Benchmarking:**
- Establish baseline performance metrics for classical vs PQC encryption
- Memory usage profiling for different key sizes and algorithms
- Network latency impact analysis for encrypted email transmission
- Scalability testing for enterprise deployment scenarios

## Dependencies
- Task 004: PQC key management system must be complete
- Task 005: Email encryption/decryption workflows implemented  
- Task 006: Admin dashboard and key lifecycle management operational
- External: Access to security testing tools and performance monitoring infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40
- Parallel: false

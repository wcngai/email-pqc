# Task: Outlook Add-in Framework

## Description
Build the foundational Outlook add-in framework that provides deep integration with Microsoft Outlook for PQC email operations. This includes setting up the project structure, implementing COM interop for native Outlook integration, and creating a ribbon-based user interface with real-time cryptographic status indicators.

## Acceptance Criteria
- VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) project successfully configured for Outlook integration
- COM interop layer implemented for accessing Outlook's native email objects and events
- Custom ribbon UI created with PQC encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify buttons
- Status indicators show real-time cryptographic state of emails (encrypted, signed, verified)
- Add-in loads automatically with Outlook and handles email lifecycle events

## Technical Details
**Project Structure:**
- VSTO Outlook Add-in project targeting Outlook 2016+ compatibility
- Proper manifest configuration for security permissions and COM registration
- Assembly signing and ClickOnce deployment preparation
- Support for both 32-bit and 64-bit Outlook installations

**COM Interop Implementation:**
- Direct integration with Outlook Object Model (Application, MailItem, Inspector objects)
- Event handlers for email compose, send, receive, and display events
- Property accessors for email headers, body content, and attachment manipulation
- Thread-safe operations for UI updates from background cryptographic operations

**Ribbon UI Framework:**
- Custom ribbon tab "PQC Security" with grouped controls
- Dynamic button states based on email content analysis
- Status indicators: encrypted (green lock), signed (blue shield), verified (checkmark), error (red warning)
- Context-sensitive tooltips showing cryptographic details
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

**Integration Points:**
- Email compose window integration for real-time encryption status
- Reading pane integration for decryption and signature verification
- Context menus for right-click encrypt/decrypt operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Dependencies
- Visual Studio with Office Development Tools installed
- Microsoft Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIAs) for Outlook
- Windows Registry access for COM registration
- No external task dependencies - can be developed independently

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 25-30
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] VSTO project structure implemented with proper configuration
- [ ] COM interop code completed for all required Outlook integration points
- [ ] Ribbon UI implemented with all planned controls and status indicators
- [ ] Event handling system working for email lifecycle events
- [ ] Unit tests written for add-in initialization and UI components
- [ ] Integration tests verify proper Outlook interaction
- [ ] Installation package created with proper signing and deployment
- [ ] Documentation covers installation, configuration, and usage
- [ ] Code reviewed for COM interop best practices and memory management
- [ ] Deployed to staging with test Outlook environment

# Task: Certificate Management Core

## Description
Implement comprehensive certificate management system that integrates with Windows Certificate Store for PQC and hybrid certificates. This system manages dual keypairs for signing and encryption operations, handles certificate enrollment, validation, and provides seamless integration with existing PKI infrastructure while supporting post-quantum certificate formats.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Windows Certificate Store integration implemented with support for PQC certificate extensions
- Dual keypair management system created for separate signing and encryption keys
- Certificate enrollment process implemented for both self-signed and CA-issued certificates
- Certificate validation engine supports hybrid certificate chains (PQC + classical)
- Certificate lifecycle management includes renewal, revocation, and backup/restore functionality

## Technical Details
**Windows Certificate Store Integration:**
- Utilize System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates namespace for store access
- Implement custom certificate store locations for PQC certificates if needed
- Support for Personal, Trusted Root, and Intermediate Certificate Authority stores
- Certificate installation with proper access control and permissions

**Dual Keypair Architecture:**
- Separate key containers for signing (ML-DSA-65) and encryption (ML-KEM-768) operations
- Key derivation and storage using Windows CNG (Cryptography Next Generation)
- Secure key storage with hardware security module (HSM) support where available
- Key backup and recovery mechanisms with encrypted export/import

**Certificate Enrollment System:**
- Self-signed certificate generation for testing and development environments
- Integration with Microsoft Certificate Services or third-party CAs
- PKCS#10 certificate request generation with PQC algorithm identifiers
- Automatic certificate renewal with configurable advance notice periods

**Hybrid Certificate Support:**
- Dual certificate chains supporting both PQC and classical algorithms
- Certificate path validation for mixed algorithm environments
- Trust store management for transitional period compatibility
- Certificate policy enforcement and compliance checking

**Certificate Lifecycle Management:**
- Certificate discovery and inventory across multiple stores
- Expiration monitoring with automated renewal workflows
- Certificate revocation list (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support
- Secure certificate backup with encrypted storage

## Dependencies
- Windows Certificate Store APIs and CNG cryptographic providers
- .NET X.509 certificate handling capabilities
- Windows Registry access for certificate store configuration
- No external task dependencies - can be developed independently

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 30-35
- Parallel: true
